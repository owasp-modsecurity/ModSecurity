# This ruleset is a complementary to ruleset 34 - Ignore Static. By default,
#   ruleset 34 doesn't skip inspection for leakages in html/documents.
#   Adding this ruleset to your configuration will cause ModSecurity to also
#   skip the rules in files
#


# Skip outbound inspection on requests for text content which have no parameters
