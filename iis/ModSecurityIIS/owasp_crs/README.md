# OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)

ModSecurity™ is a web application firewall engine that provides very little protection on its own. In order to become useful, ModSecurity™ must be configured with rules. In order to enable users to take full advantage of ModSecurity™ out of the box, Trustwave's SpiderLabs is sponsoring and maintaining a free certified rule set for the community. Unlike intrusion detection and prevention systems, which rely on signatures specific to known vulnerabilities, the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set provides generic protection from unknown vulnerabilities often found in web applications, which are in most cases custom coded. The Core Rules are heavily commented to allow it to be used as a step-by-step deployment guide for ModSecurity™.
