# Instead of creating rule set based on analyzing saved audit log data, we can
# instead profile live transactions in phase:5 post processing and save data in
# Resource-based persistent collections.  Once we have seen enough traffic (as
# defined below) we can then move into Enforcement Mode.
#

#
# --[ Step 1: Initiate the Resource Collection ]--
#
# We are using the REQUEST_FILENAME as the key and then set 2 variables -
#
# [resource.min_pattern_threshold]
# Set the resource.min_pattern_threshold as the minimum number of times that a match should occur 
# in order to include it into the profile
#
# [resource.min_traffic_threshold] 
# Set the resource.min_traffic_threshold as the minimum number of "clean" transactions
# to profile/inspect before enforcement of the profile begins.
#
SecAction "phase:1,id:'981082',t:none,nolog,pass,initcol:resource=%{request_headers.host}_%{request_filename},setvar:resource.min_pattern_threshold=50,setvar:resource.min_traffic_threshold=100"

#
# --[ Ignore Resource ]--
#
# If you want to exclude a resource from being profiled, you can specify it in the
# modsecurity_40_profiler_ignore.data file.  This rule will evaluate the REQUEST_FILENAME
# and if there is match in the @pmFromFile check, it will skip all profiling/enforcement
# rules in this file. We have to run two checks here -
# 1. For Phase:2 - Enforcement Checks
# 2. For Phase:5 - Profiling Analysis
#
# If there is a match, the rules will skip down until it hits the SecMarker END_PROFILER_RULES
# at the end of this file.
#
# If you want to use these rules you must:
# 1. Uncomment the rules
# 2. Create the modsecurity_40_appsensor_ignore.data file in the same directory
#
#SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@pmFromFile modsecurity_40_appsensor_ignore.data" "phase:2,id:'981083',t:none,nolog,pass,skipAfter:END_PROFILER_RULES"
#SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@pmFromFile modsecurity_40_appsensor_ignore.data" "phase:5,id:'981084',t:none,nolog,pass,skipAfter:END_PROFILER_RULES"
