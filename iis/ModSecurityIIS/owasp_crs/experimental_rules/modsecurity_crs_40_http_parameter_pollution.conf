# The rules in this file are considered experimental/beta rules.  They attempt to address
# some advanced attacks, use some new ModSecurity features or new rules language techniques.
#

#
# HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)
#
# One HPP attack vector is to try evade signature filters by distributing the attack payload
# across multiple parameters with the same name.  This works as many security devices only
# apply signatures to individual parameter payloads, however the back-end web application
# may (in the case of ASP.NET) consolidate all of the payloads into one thus making the 
# attack payload active.
#
# -=[ Rules Logic }=-
# The ruleset below is not looking for attacks directly, but rather is a crude normalization
# function that mimics ASP.NET with regards to joining the payloads of parameters with the
# same name.  These rules will create a new TX:HPP_DATA variable that will hold this data.
# If you have enabled PARANOID_MODE, then this variable data will also be searched against
# attack filters.
