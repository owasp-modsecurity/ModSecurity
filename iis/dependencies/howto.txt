WARNING!

Building ModSecurityIIS on Windows is a relatively complicated process. Understanding it requires advanced knowledge of Windows and Unix environments.
Using the same versions of libraries as listed below is strongly recommended.

--------------------------------------
Tested on:

Windows 7 x64
Vistual Studio 2010 Ultimate SP1
IIS enabled/installed

cmake 2.8.7
curl 7.24.0
apache 2.2.22 or apache 2.4.3
libxml2 2.7.7
lua 5.1.5
pcre 8.30
zlib 1.2.7
7-Zip
--------------------------------------

1. Create working directory c:\work and drop directory c:\drop
2. Sync SVN ModSecurity branch to c:\work\mod_security
3. Copy files from c:\work\mod_security\iis\winbuild to c:\work
4. Download and install cmake (unpack to c:\work\cmake-2.8.7-win32-x86)
5. Download and install 7-Zip
6. Adjust paths in c:\work\init.bat accordingly if needed
7. Download curl, apache, libxml2, lua, pcre and zlib, place them in zip files in c:\work

curl-7.24.0.zip
httpd-2.2.22-win32-src.zip or (httpd-2.4.3.zip (source) and httpd-2.4.3-win32.zip + httpd-2.4.3-win64.zip (binaries))
libxml2-2.7.7.zip
lua-5.1.5.zip
pcre-8.30.zip
zlib-1.2.7.zip

Modify c:\work\build.bat accordingly (if other versions were used)

8. Open cmd.exe window, go to c:\work and run buildall.bat
9. When done, the binaries, lib and pdb files should appear under c:\drop\x86 (32-bit) and c:\drop\amd64 (64-bit)
10. Open the VS ModSecurity IIS installer project
11. Copy new binaries to the installer's x86 and amd64 directories
