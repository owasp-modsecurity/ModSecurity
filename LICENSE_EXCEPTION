ModSecurity Licensing Exception

Version 1.0 draft 5, 18 June 2008

As a special exception ("Exception") to the terms and conditions of version 2 of the
GPL, Breach Security, Inc. hereby grants you the rights described below, provided
you agree to the terms and conditions in this Exception, including its obligations and
restrictions on use.

Exception Intent

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS") programs to be
able to use ModSecurity (the "Program") despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses
are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPLv2").

Legal Terms and Conditions

You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Program
and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the
licenses listed below in section 1, as long as all of the following conditions are met:

1. You obey the GPLv2 in all respects for the Program and the Derivative Work,
   except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are

   1. not derived from the Program, and

   2. are not designed to interact with the Program, and

   3. which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in
      themselves.

2. All such identifiable sections of the Derivative Work are

   1. distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and

   2. the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied
      by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those
      sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the
      corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections.

3. Any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative Work
   on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the
   GPLv2, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in
   themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative Work
   or a FLOSS Work, and are not designed to interact with the Program.

If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied, modified,
distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPLv2 or another valid
licensing option from Breach Security, Inc.

Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we require that for any
version of the listed FLOSS licenses to qualify under this exception, it must follow
the 2003 version of the Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of the Open Source
Definition by the Open Source Initiative
(http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).


2. Definitions

   1. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the
      version 2 of the GPL.

   2. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.


3. Applicability

This Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice placed by Breach
Security, Inc. saying that the Program may be distributed under the terms of this
Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the
Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is
not available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from
that work and comply with the GPL in all respects, including by retaining all GPL
notices.

You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of
the GPLv2 by removing the Exception notice from that copy of the Program, provided
that the copy has never been modified by you or any third party.


Appendix A. Qualified Libraries and Packages

Compliance with one of the licenses noted under the "FLOSS license list" section
