# We are going to run the build in a container. 
# The reason we run the build in a container is that we have dependency on protobuf when we are building on Linux. 
# Building protobuf as a build step is quite time consuming, so we want to package the protobuf as a container image with all the dependencies captured and run the build within this container.
