# Uncomment the anomaly sections you wish to use.
# You should set the score to the proper threshold you would prefer. If kept at "@gt 0"
# it will work similarly to previous Mod CRS rules and will create an event in the error_log
# file if there are any rules that match.  If you would like to lessen the number of events
# generated in the error_log file, you should increase the anomaly score threshold to
# something like "@gt 20".  This would only generate an event in the error_log file if
# there are multiple lower severity rule matches or if any 1 higher severity item matches.
#
# You should also set the desired disruptive action (deny, redirect, etc...).
#

# Alert and Deny on High Anomaly Scores
